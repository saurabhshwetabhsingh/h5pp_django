				<p>
					To use H5PP you need a set of files named "libraries" that contains the necessary to create different types of content.<br>
					You can find the official release of H5P, containing many content types, at this adress :
					<a href="https://h5p.org/sites/default/files/official-h5p-release-20170301.h5p">Official release</a><br>

						<i>Only super-user can access to this page.</i>
					</p>
				</p>
				<h4 class="info-heading">Editor</h4>
				<p>
					To create, upload or edit a content you need to use the editor provided by H5P.<br>
					All content is identified by a title, set during creation, a identifier (ID) created automatically after the creation and their author.<br>
					Everybody can view a content, but only authenticated users can create content. The owner of the content can edit or delete his content.
				</p>
				<h4 class="info-heading">Contents</h4>
				<p>
					Anytime, you can consult the list of created contents.<br>
					It is through this list that you can view, edit, delete and show the users score of these contents.
				</p>
				<h4 class="info-heading">Scores</h4>
				<p>
					Interactive video contents have a score system. When an interactive video has activities with a point system, the user then has a score.<br>
					You can verify the scores obtained by users who saw your video. If you are the owner of this video you can reset any user score on your video if you want, or you can reset all the scores obtained on this video.
					<p>
						<i>Only super-user can download a .txt who summarizes users score of a video or all the existing videos for statistical surveys.</i>
